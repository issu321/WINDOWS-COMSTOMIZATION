UPDATE LOG:

-------------------
v4 - Mar 27, 2021
-------------------

GENERAL:
- Reduced size by 6%.
- Graphic enhancements.
- Slightly tilted to the right.
- Added 20+ new bonus cursors.
- Added a faint extra gloss on the texture.
- Animation enhancements; animations are now faster and snappier.

- A "Pointing Hand" variation for the link select is now available.
- A "Loop" variations are now available for select states.
- DIM is now available in 32 and 48 px format. 32 is the default for 100%-125% scale, and 48 for beyond 150%.
- Updated the installer file (.inf). Now it will also copy the "Bonus Cursors" folder in the installation directory (C:\Windows\Cursors). No need to do it manually.
- Shortened cursors and folder names to prevent errors concerning Windows "File location" character limit. These errors usually make some cursor file unselectable or the thumbnails not loading in the File Explorer.
- Due to Windows' 1809 update bug still unpatched by Microsoft, the default "Normal" is temporarily set to a non-animated (.cur) variation to prevent the glitch bug. The classic animated is still available inside the "Bonus Cursors" folder. Alternatively, if you want all of the states to be animated, use the new "Loop" variations inside the Bonus Cursors folder.
